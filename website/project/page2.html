					<h3>INSTRUCTIONS</H3>
					<p>first, using the cube.dxf file included, laser cut out the faces of the cube using a sheet of acrylic glass 3mm thick. Assemble the cube and glue it together, except for the face with the hole in it.</p>
					<p>Next, assemble the circuit with the instructed componenets. Sound Sensor's OUT pin is connected to A3, while the legs of the RGB LED are connected as follows: R to D4, G to D8, B to D10. The remaining leg is to be connected to GND.</p>
					<p>insert the circuit into the cube with the mini USB wire connected through the hole of the last cube face, before sealing said face to the rest of the cube.</p>
					<p>Connect the mini USB wire to your computer and start up Arduino IDE, running the code.txt file provided. Make sure that the "Tools" is set to Arduino Nano.</p>
